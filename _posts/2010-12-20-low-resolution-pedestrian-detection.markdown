Robust object detection is important for many applications. In particular, in the context of video surveillance, pedestrians are very important, and very challenging, class of objects to detect. This is one of the main challenges of the [SAMURAI project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/217899) on which I have spent three years. See in the following video an example of my contribution.
