Fillersâ€™ monitoring is one of the key components to ensure reliable machines and to meet production goals.

In today's marketplace, even companies with medium production volumes - up to 7 million cartons/year - need to plan packaging and delivery in a precise and dependable way.

This is even more true for big food manufacturers operating with tight production schedules, for whom machine downtimes can cause significant financial losses and also harm the company's image.

Considering the extent to which the fillers' efficiency affects line production performances and OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), Galdi has been developing a fillers' monitoring system, called MaSH (Machine System Health), since the end of 2017, which aims at:

* anticipating and preventing downtimes
* providing detailed production data
* improving the work of operators and maintenance technicians
