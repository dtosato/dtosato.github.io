Many problems in computer vision uses matrices (or tensors) to describe data. Matrix spaces have a so-called manifold structure. I am interested in building machine learning approaches for classification and regression problems on those spaces. I spent most of my efforts in working on SPD (Symmetric Positive Definite) matrices (see [Tosato et al. - 2010](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0MZ5gr7K36ScHV1OXR3UnNlb3M/view?usp=sharing)).
