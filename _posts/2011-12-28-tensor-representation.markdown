Employing tensor representation, it is able to describe the interactions of multiple factors inherent to image formation and separately encode the higher-order statistics of each of these factors. One of the most convenient uses for tensors is to represent complex objects in order to build a discriminative representation (see [Tosato et al. 2011](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0MZ5gr7K36SemN2SGJLSlczTkE)).
