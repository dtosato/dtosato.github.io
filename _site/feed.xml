While many approaches were proposed for single-class classification, multi-label classification in the continual scenario remains a challenging problem. For the first time, we study multi-label classification in the Domain Incremental Learning scenario. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach that has a logarithmic complexity with regard to the number of tasks, and can be applied also in the Class Incremental Learning scenario. We validate our approach on a real-world multi-label Alarm Forecasting problem from the packaging industry. For the sake of reproducibility, the dataset and the code used for the experiments are publicly available.</p>

However, standard Predictive Maintenance approaches assume the availability of sensor measurements, and the costs associated with adding sensors or remotely accessing sensor readings may discourage the development of such technologies. In this context, Alarm Forecasting can be very useful as it represents a low-cost alternative or helpful support to sensor-based Predictive Maintenance. In this work, we propose a new formulation for the Alarm Forecasting problem, framed as a multi-label classification task. We present a novel deep learning-based approach called FORMULA (alarm FORecasting in MUlti-LAbel setting). FORMULA leverages Transformer, a popular Neural Network architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing. To cope with alarm imbalance, we draw inspiration from Segmentation and Object Detection. Thus, FORMULA is trained by minimizing the Weighted Focal Loss, which turns out to be very effective in predicting rare alarms. These alarms, even if they are difficult to predict by nature, often are business-critical. We assess the proposed approach on a representative real-world problem from the packaging industry. In particular, we show that it outperforms not only classic multilabel techniques but also models based on recurrent neural networks. As regards the latter, the proposed approach also exhibits a lower computational burden, both in terms of training time and model size. To foster research in the field and reproducibility, we also publicly share the alarm logs dataset and the code used to perform the experiments. Note to Practitioners —This paper was motivated by the problem of monitoring equipment in the scenario of dairy products packaging, under the mild assumption that logs of the alarm generated by the packaging machines are available. This paper proposes an alarm forecasting algorithm. Its goal is to predict if any alarm will occur in the future, based only on past alarm logs. The limits of the considered future window can be defined arbitrarily, so there is enough time to perform corrective actions. Thus, the proposed approach aims to prevent unexpected downtime that would not only hinder productivity but also imply significant material waste. The proposed approach leverages methodologies from Natural Language Processing and Object Detection to deal with rare alarms that are often very informative in the industrial scenario. Besides, both the code and the real-world industrial datasets used to evaluate the methodology are available publicly. Currently, the proposed approach only uses alarm logs. Especially in the context of Industry 4.0, where many sensory data may be available, this is a limitation. Thus, the described approach might be extended by integrating alarm logs with sensory data. This integration is expected to improve the estimation of equipment health state. The results described in this paper may find application not only in the manufacturing sector but also in different areas such as Cyber Security, where log files keep activity records of each process performed.</p>

<p>We published <a href="https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/alarm-logs-packaging-industry-alpi">a dataset</a> of the alarms coming from Galdi’s machines. You can find down here a small abstract.</p>

<p>The advent of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has led to the availability of huge amounts of data, that can be used to train advanced Machine Learning algorithms to perform tasks such as Anomaly Detection, Fault Classification and Predictive Maintenance. Even though not all pieces of equipment are equipped with sensors yet, usually most of them are already capable of logging warnings and alarms occurring during operation. Turning this data, which is easy to collect, into meaningful information about the health state of machinery can have a disruptive impact on the improvement of efficiency and up-time. The provided dataset consists of a sequence of alarms logged by packaging equipment in an industrial environment. The collection includes data logged by 20 machines, deployed in different plants around the world, from 2019-02-21 to 2020-06-17. There are 154 distinct alarm codes, whose distribution is highly unbalanced.</p>

  <li>Next alarm forecasting: this problem can be framed as a supervised multi-class classification task, or a binary classification task when a specific alarm code is considered.</li>
  <li>Predicting alarms occurring in a future time frame: here the goal is to forecast the occurrence of certain alarm types in a future time window. Since many alarms can occur, this is a supervised multi-label classification.</li>
  <li>Future alarm sequence prediction: here the goal is predicting an ordered sequence of future alarms, in a sequence-to-sequence forecasting scenario.</li>
  <li>Anomaly Detection: the task is to detect abnormal equipment conditions, based on the pattern of alarms sequence. This task can be either unsupervised, if only the input sequence is considered, or supervised if future alarms are taken into account to assess whether or not there is an anomaly.</li>

<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920300342">this work</a>, we propose a Deep Learning-based approach for production performance forecasting in fresh products packaging. On the one hand, this is a very demanding scenario where high throughput is mandatory; on the other, due to strict hygiene requirements, unexpected downtime caused by packaging machines can lead to huge product waste. Thus, our aim is predicting future values of key performance indexes such as Machine Mechanical Efficiency (MME) and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).We address this problem by leveraging Deep Learning-based approaches to exploit the full informative content of available historical data. In the proposed approach, we consider historical production performance data and measurements about warnings and alarms occurred during production stage, and combine them as a composite input to the neural network. The network the predicts future values for OEE and MME. Different architectures and prediction horizons are analyzed and compared to identify the most robust and effective solutions. We provide experimental results on a real industrial case, showing advantages with regard to current policies implemented by the industrial partner both in terms of forecasting accuracy and maintenance costs.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="post" /><category term="iiot" /><category term="ai" /><category term="deep-learning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Learning-based Production Forecasting in Manufacturing: a Packaging Equipment Case Study]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/dlpm.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/dlpm.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Machine System Health (MaSH)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/post/2019/06/11/mash.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Machine System Health (MaSH)" /><published>2019-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/post/2019/06/11/mash</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/post/2019/06/11/mash.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/mash.png" alt="MaSH" /></p>

<p>Fillers’ monitoring is one of the key components to ensure reliable machines and to meet production goals.</p>

<p>In today’s marketplace, even companies with medium production volumes - up to 7 million cartons/year - need to plan packaging and delivery in a precise and dependable way.</p>

<p>This is even more true for big food manufacturers operating with tight production schedules, for whom machine downtimes can cause significant financial losses and also harm the company’s image.</p>

<p>Considering the extent to which the fillers’ efficiency affects line production performances and OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), Galdi has been developing a fillers’ monitoring system, called MaSH (Machine System Health), since the end of 2017, which aims at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offering a detailed view of the machine’s efficiency</li>
  <li>anticipating and preventing downtimes</li>
  <li>providing detailed production data</li>
  <li>improving the work of operators and maintenance technicians</li>
</ul>
